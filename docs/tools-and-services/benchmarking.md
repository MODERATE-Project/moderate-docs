# Contextual Anomaly Detector Tool

!!! abstract "Abstract"

    The benchmarking tool is designed to visualize, compare, and analyze the performance of buildings using specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This tool evaluates various types of data, from tabular data like Energy Performance Certificates to time-series data directly monitored in the building, considering not only energy consumption but also comfort conditions.
    With correct data normalization, an energy manager can assess building trends using simple graphs and identify potential improvement actions, reducing consumption and/or enhancing comfort conditions. Additionally, the tool can provide insights into energy efficiency measures and their impact on operational costs, allowing for more informed decision-making and strategic planning. 

## Introduction

In an era where energy efficiency and sustainability are key priorities, understanding how a building performs compared to industry benchmarks is essential. The Building Benchmarking Tool is a web-based platform that enables users to analyze and compare the energy performance of buildings.
By leveraging a comprehensive database of reference buildings, the tool provides insights into energy consumption, indoor comfort, and efficiency levels, helping professionals make data-driven decisions. Through interactive visualizations and customizable inputs, users can assess their buildingâ€™s energy footprint, identify potential inefficiencies, and explore strategies for optimization. Additionally, the tool considers climate zone variations, ensuring that benchmarks are accurate and region-specific.
Whether you are an energy manager,  energy consultant, or building owner, this tool serves as a valuable resource for improving sustainability and reducing operational costs
A new section has been integrated into the tool that includes the evaluation of possible sensor malfunctions or anomalies. This part represents a preliminary assessment of the integration of moderate applications such as fault detection.
