## üèòÔ∏è LEC Assessment Tool

Local Energy Communities (LECs) are pivotal in advancing building decarbonization,fostering social cohesion, and promoting the integration of renewable energy sources. This tool streamlines the establishment of LECs by pinpointing optimal locations for their formation, enabling stakeholders to efficiently identify viable LEC sites.

## üìà Contextual Anomaly Detector

The _Contextual Anomaly Detector_ identifies anomalies in meter-level energy consumption using supervised and unsupervised analytics combined with the distance-based contextual matrix profile (CMP) algorithm. It autonomously detects infrequent patterns in energy timeseries, applies boundary conditions, and ranks anomalies by severity based on load shape and magnitude. With self-tuning capabilities, the tool helps energy and facility managers detect abnormal energy usage and inefficiencies, enabling informed decisions to reduce waste and optimize performance.

## ‚ö° Energy System Optimization

The _Energy System Optimization_ tool offers a customizable environment for optimizing building energy systems through time series data analytics. Through the SYNAVISION platform, it enables smart control of heating requirements based on weather forecasts, allowing for automated temperature adjustments that maximize comfort while minimizing energy consumption. The tool is especially effective when integrated with MyGekko building automation systems.
