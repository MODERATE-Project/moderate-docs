!!! info "Availability of public tools and services"

    MODERATE is under active development, so the infrastructure may occasionally be offline for maintenance, cost optimization, or other development purposes. If any links are not working, please either wait for redeployment or contact us via email for access.

## üìä Building Benchmarking

Benchmarking is a web tool that allows the comparison of building performances. It provides a comprehensive view of energy efficiency and performance metrics for a selected building, including the most relevant KPIs and their interdependencies.

## üß† BrickLLM

BrickLLM is a web application that generates RDF files conforming to the BrickSchema ontology by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The application is built on top of the Python library BrickLLM.

## üìà Contextual Anomaly Detector

The _Contextual Anomaly Detector_ identifies anomalies in meter-level energy consumption using supervised and unsupervised analytics combined with the distance-based contextual matrix profile (CMP) algorithm. It autonomously detects infrequent patterns in energy timeseries, applies boundary conditions, and ranks anomalies by severity based on load shape and magnitude. With self-tuning capabilities, the tool helps energy and facility managers detect abnormal energy usage and inefficiencies, enabling informed decisions to reduce waste and optimize performance.

- :fontawesome-solid-book: &nbsp; [Documentation](cmp.md)

## üèòÔ∏è LEC Assessment Tool

Local Energy Communities (LECs) are pivotal in advancing building decarbonization,fostering social cohesion, and promoting the integration of renewable energy sources. This tool streamlines the establishment of LECs by pinpointing optimal locations for their formation, enabling stakeholders to efficiently identify viable LEC sites.

- :fontawesome-solid-book: &nbsp; [Documentation](lec.md)


## üåû Solar Cadastre

The _Solar Cadastre (SC)_ enables users to evaluate the solar energy potential of buildings and assess the efficiency of installed solar panels. Through an interactive map, users can select buildings, perform energy calculations, and retrieve cadastral data to support decision-making.
