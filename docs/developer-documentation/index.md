# Developer documentation

This section contains design decisions, guides, and tutorials intended for the internal MODERATE development team or other technically oriented developers interacting with the MODERATE platform at a low level.

These decisions are kept alongside more publicly oriented documentation for traceability purposes and to centralize information. If you are an end user seeking to learn more about MODERATE's tools and services, this subsection is likely outside your scope. Additionally, some of these design decisions may evolve or change over time, and the pages within risk becoming outdated.
