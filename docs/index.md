# Welcome to MODERATE

Welcome to the documentation of the MODERATE platform :wave:

The MODERATE project is funded under the Horizon Europe program. Its main objective is to develop services and tools that focus on building-related data sources and datasets.

MODERATE consists of three main components:

* A collection of well-curated public datasets related to the building sector
* A suite of web applications and CLI tools designed to address specific challenges in building data analysis ([see Tools and Services](tools-and-services) for details)
* The MODERATE Platform at [www.moderate.cloud](https://www.moderate.cloud): a central web application that serves as both an entry point to various tools and a catalog for uploading, browsing, and downloading datasets, along with other proof-of-concept features

## What can MODERATE do for you?

While MODERATE is still in its early stages as a research project, we're excited to share several valuable resources that might benefit your work:

* Explore our tools and services: While some are specialized for specific use cases, they represent cutting-edge solutions that could help address your current challenges
* Adapt our tools to your needs: Even if our tools don't perfectly match your use case, you can fork them and build upon our solid foundation
* Discover our Platform UI: We offer user-friendly tools for data exploration, dataset management, and synthetic data generation
* Access curated datasets: We maintain a small collection of high-quality datasets available through both GitHub and our Platform UI, ready for your research and innovation projects
