# Welcome to MODERATE

Welcome to the documentation of the MODERATE platform :wave:

The MODERATE project is funded under the Horizon Europe program. Its main objective is to develop services and tools that focus on building-related data sources and datasets.

MODERATE consists of three main components:

* A collection of well-curated public datasets related to the building sector
* A suite of web applications and CLI tools designed to address specific challenges in building data analysis ([see Tools and Services](tools-and-services) for details)
* The MODERATE Platform at [www.moderate.cloud](https://www.moderate.cloud): a central web application that serves as both an entry point to various tools and a catalog for uploading, browsing, and downloading datasets, along with other proof-of-concept features
