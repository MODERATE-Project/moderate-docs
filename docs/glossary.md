| Term     | Definition                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Data owner | Owner of an datasets or services |
| Decentralized Identifiers  | Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) epresent a novel form of URIs. They serve to reference a subject and facilitate trustworthy interactions related to that subject. To obtain additional information, please refer to the DID standard. [https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) |
| Metadata | Information regarding datasets or services, delineating their content, context, data format and associated rights. |  
| MODERATE Platform | The platform encompasses all cloud services and applications generated by the MODERATE project. Essentially, it is the unified entity that enables the collaboration of the various outputs of the project, including ML models, web applications, and supporting services like Identity and Access Management. |
| Storage & Analytics Layer | The subset of services within the platform that facilitate the storage of diverse data assets and their efficient processing. These services include, for example, relational databases, object-storage services and workflow orchestration tools. |
| Analytics | The examination of large datasets using mathematical methods (e.g. statistical methods) and/or machine learning approaches to devise meaningful models of building-related processes. |
| Tools | The software means (i.e. both the front and back-ends) to allow a user to interact with the models and request to, and obtain services from the MODERATE platform. | 
| Services | The ultimate scope of MODERATE platform, to provide users insight into the building-related processes and let them gain new knowledge and decision-making capacity. | 
| Trust proof | Cryptographic proof employed to verify the authenticity and integrity of an asset and its metadata. This proof is stored on the Tangle to ensure immutability. |
